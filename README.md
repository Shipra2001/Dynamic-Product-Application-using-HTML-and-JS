# Dynamic-Product-Application-using-HTML-and-JS

This project is a dynamic shopping list application that allows users to input product names, prices, and ratings, which are then displayed in a bar graph format. The application includes features to sort the graphs by price or rating and ensures real-time updates when new data is added. The implementation uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic content updating. The project highlights key front-end development skills, including creating interactive user interfaces and manipulating data visually without relying on external libraries.
