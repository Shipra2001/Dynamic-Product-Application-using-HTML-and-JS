# Product Price and Rating Graphs

This project is a simple web application that allows users to input product data (name, price, and rating) and dynamically display the prices and ratings in a bar graph format. The application also includes sorting functionality to organize the graphs based on price and rating.

## Features

- **Add Products**: Input product name, price, and rating, and see the data represented as bar graphs.
- **Dynamic Bar Graphs**: The bar graphs for prices and ratings are dynamically updated when new products are added.
- **Sorting Functionality**: Sort the graphs based on price or rating with a simple click of a button.

5. Click the `Add Product` button to add the product to the list.

### 2. View Bar Graphs
